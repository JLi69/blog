title:  "Reviewing 2023"
---

Man, 2023 was a wild year. We saw the rise of generative AI, 
[claims that the United States government is hiding aliens](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/27/1190390376/ufo-hearing-non-human-biologics-uaps),
and probably many other crazy things that I forgot about. However,
I have also done some fun things with my personal life as well. I learned more
about programming and I have created many projects that I am quite proud of.
You can check out a review of every game that I made in 2023 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_zTCKaJvy4)
if that sounds interesting.

Here are some of the highlights from my year:

I created a [Terraria clone](https://github.com/JLi69/terratest) and I had a
lot of fun creating it. It was especially fun to share my progress with my
friends and the internet and this project actually ended up growing my YouTube
channel quite a bit which was an added bonus. There are some things that I
don't like about the project in hindsight and I am considering in the future
(probably not anytime soon though) to rewrite the project to be something better
and perhaps something even bigger though I make no gaurantees.

I learned the Rust programming language and I can say that while Rust has some
issues (long compile times...) it also has many positives that I like and I
enjoy the lanugage. Some of the fun projects that I have made using Rust include
[Krab Kart](https://github.com/JLi69/krab-kart), 
[Scale The Tower](https://github.com/JLi69/scale-the-tower),
and [Sandpaint](https://github.com/JLi69/sandpaint).

I also learned Lua and created a game which allowed for enemies to be scripted
in Lua ([Galaxy Invaders](https://github.com/JLi69/galaxy_invaders)), and created
a game using the [LÃ–VE](https://www.love2d.org/) game engine for the GMTK
game jam ([Sokobash](https://nullptr-error.itch.io/sokobash))
and also ported my Neovim config to Lua.

Overall, there are still many things that I want to learn (programming and
non-programming alike) and I unfortunately didn't set aside enough time
(or I lost motivation or ended up getting distracted by something else) to
learn these things. Hopefully in 2024 I can get enough motivation and time to
learn the stuff that I want to know more about. I'll also probably end finding
new things that I want to know more about.

Hopefully 2024 will be another year of adventures and new projects (that are
hopefully better than the projects that I worked on in 2023!). Also hopefully
the world doesn't end next year as well. 2023 was wild, but I have a feeling
that 2024 will be even more crazy.

Anyway, have a happy new year and may 2024 be a successful year for all of us!
