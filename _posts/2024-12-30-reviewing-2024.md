title:  "Reviewing 2024"
---

Wow, it's hard to believe that 2024 is nearly over! It's been a year since my
post [reviewing my projects in 2023](https://jli69.github.io/blog/2023/12/30/reviewing-2023.html)
and so much has changed since then. Like I did last year, I made a video summarizing
what programming projects I did this year so you can watch it
[on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyFDyoQJK8). This post will also provide
a summary of this year as well.

Towards the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024 I was interested in the
[Wave Function Collapse Algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse),
which I thought was one of the most interesting and coolest procedural generation
algorithms that I have ever seen. Therefore I attempted to make my own
[implementation](https://github.com/JLi69/wave-function-collapse-demo) and while I
had some difficulty in the beginning, I was eventually able to get it to work after
reading this [paper](https://adamsmith.as/papers/wfc_is_constraint_solving_in_the_wild.pdf).

After that, I decided to work on upgrading how [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)
worked on my system and I have a post going over it 
[here](https://jli69.github.io/blog/2024/01/12/playing-with-dmenu.html). Basically,
I just created a way for the desktop files on my system to be listed out and then
piped into dmenu where I could then run them.

The next projects that I worked on were [infworld](https://github.com/JLi69/infworld) and
[Flight & Fight](https://github.com/JLi69/flight-and-fight). Infworld was an experiment
to see if I could create an infinite world generator using perlin noise and display it with
OpenGL, overall a very fun project to work on and I really liked how it looks in the end.
Flight & Fight then used that code to generate the background world in which the player
could fly a plane around and fight other planes. You can check out Flight & Fight
[on itch.io](https://nullptr-error.itch.io/flight-fight).

During the summer some friends and I decided that we wanted to work together to make some
games with the Godot Game Engine. The first game we made together was 
[Birb Run](https://github.com/Birb-Games/birb-run). It was a somewhat simple platformer
game in which you control a Birb and have to help it navigate various strange worlds.
It was a fun project to work on and it was the first project that I worked on
collaboratively with another person. We then joined the 
[2024 GMTK game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024) and submitted
[The Server Must Scale](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024/rate/2908365) which was
a factory builder game in which you have to build a "Server" that needs to process
an ever increasing amount of data.

One game that I worked on solo for a bit was "Totally Historically Accurate
D-Day Simulator" (THADDDaySim), you can check out its github repo
[here](https://github.com/JLi69/thaddaysim). I wrote a 
[post](https://jli69.github.io/blog/2024/11/28/totally-historically-accurate-dday-sim.html)
about it so check it out. The basic idea behind it was that two players controlled
the Axis and Allied soldiers on DDay and the Allies have to get to the other side
of the map in order to capture the flag of the Axis while the Axis has to stop
them. It still needs some work but it is a fairly fun game.

Finally, we have Voxelworld. This is a Minecraft clone that I'm working on to
see what goes into making a voxel engine and I think it would also be cool to
have my own personal voxel engine. It's still a work in progress but I intend
on continuing work on it in the new year. You can check out the source code
[here](https://github.com/JLi69/voxelworld).

Anyway, that's it, have a nice day and may 2025 be a successful year for us all!
