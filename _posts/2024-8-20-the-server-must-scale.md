Over the course of about 96 hours, two my friends 
([cfinn](https://github.com/cfinn68916) and [gldeA](https://github.com/gldeA))
and I worked together to create a game for the 2024 GMTK Game Jam. The theme of
the jam was "Built to Scale" and we thought it would be interesting if we were to
build a game based on "scaling up" in software development (building a program that
is able to handle more data efficiently). The basic idea behind this game is that
you have to manage and build a server farm that needs to efficiently distribute
the load of the input data so that the servers do not get backed up and crash.
Data comes in faster as time goes on so you have to expand and plan your layout
to account for that.

Overall, this was a fairly new type of game for us to work on as we have never made
a factory builder game like Factorio or Mindustry before and it was an interesting
effort to figure out how to implement things like conveyor belts, splitters, and
mergers. At times it got a little frustrating with the sheer number of bugs we had
to deal with at times and sometimes I started feeling as if we had bitten of more than
we could chew for a 4 day game jam but in the end we were able to ship a decent product
which I'm proud of. The code isn't perfect and there are probably many ways it could
be improved but considering that this was a game made in 4 days I consider it to work
just fine for now.

Like with [Birb Run](https://nullptr-error.itch.io/birb-run) we used Godot as our
game engine and we built the game using GDScript. If you want, you can browse the
source code [here](https://github.com/Birb-Games/the-server-must-scale) and you
can play/download the game [on itch.io](https://itch.io/the-server-must-scale).

Anyway, that's it, have a nice day!
