Over the past couple of weeks I was working with a friend of mine to make
a simple platformer game in Godot. I have never really had much experience
collaborating with another person for creating a game (most of the time I've
been developing my projects solo) and this was a pretty new experience for me.
However, everything went very well and I really enjoyed working on Birb Run
(that's what we called the game). Anyway, this post will detail what I learned
from this project and also reflect on how it went.

## Collaborating with another human on a project
I haven't really collborated much on a programming project with another person
except for my time at my school's robotics team.

For a summary of how collaboration on the robotics team went, we had to
decide between using forks and branches and if I recall correctly, we initially
tried out forks but then opted for branches. All I really remember of using branches
for development was that there were too many merge conflicts that ended up being
a pain to deal with. Also way too much force pushing. Anyway, I left the team
before the 2024 season so I wasn't sure of what they were planning, from what my
friend told me they decided to continue with branches and didn't go to terribly.

However, after that experience, I decided to opt for forks instead for this project
and that seemed to work pretty smoothly. There were still merge conflicts that
were kind of annoying to deal with (at least Godot's stuff is all saved in plain
text so it wasn't a nightmare to fix in a plain text editor). I personally didn't
have to force push to anything so that was nice. Overall, coordinating what features to 
implement and who should implement such features went well and was a fairly good 
learning experience.

For merge conflicts, after doing some reading online I learned that perhaps
smaller localized commits are better for minimizing merge conflicts (and
apparently are better practice in general in the software development world?
I'm not quite sure what the general consensus on that is though...)

A few other things of note that happened was that I also realized the importance
of maintaining readable code and comments. I knew comments were important but as
a mostly solo developer up until this point I had been negligent with comments at
times (which is not great). One instance where this became an issue was when I
randomly added some code that deleted the player node but then instantiated it
again to reset its information when the level was loaded. I forgot to comment
this so it looked rather strange and of course since this was some random code
that appeared to do nothing without explanation, I forgot what it did and it
confused my friend which lead to them nearly deleting it. Luckily I randomly
remembered what it did and told them not to delete it and my friend was also 
nice enough to add a comment explaining what the code did. Comments are important
kids!

Still, the experience was very nice and I had a lot of fun.

## Godot
I have had some experience with Godot prior (I randomly decided to make a somewhat
bad breakout clone during a snow day, you can find a YouTube video of the gameplay
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuVE-Elc_CI)). Also, at my high school I
started a game development club and while not many people came after the first
meeting, one of the things I tried to do with a freshman (not related to this project) 
was attempt to learn Godot. We followed Godot's guide on how to make our first
2D game and I also tried to making a somewhat terrible Space Invaders clone.

However, beyond that I did not have any other projects using Godot. I normally
like creating simple projects from the ground up using C++ (or Rust for some
of my projects) and OpenGL. However, I am open to trying out new technologies.
My friend has had some experience with Godot himself (he experimented with
the Rust bindings for Godot) but I had only experience with GDSCript but we
decided to just use GDScript for this project. I know Godot also officially
supports C# and C++ but I felt that for small projects like this, GDSCript would
be just fine.

I had quite a bit to learn for this project. For one, I had to learn how TileMaps
worked and I made frequent visits to Godot's Documentation and also reading
Stack Overflow and the Godot subreddit in an attempt to learn from others having
similar issues to some problems I was having as well. I'll be honest, at times
I found some issues rather frustrating to solve (one specific example was that
I could not find anything for the life of me on how to disable the collision of
a TileMap - I wanted to create a background layer which of course cannot have 
collision - this was rather annoying and I just came up with a hack where I just
made a new TileMap and created a new TileSet without a physics layer. I'm pretty
sure there was a better method but I don't really care to find out right now).
However, I think I still learned quite a bit about Godot and I feel more
comfortable using the engine now. I'll probably still make projects in C++ and
Rust though for things like game jams I might use Godot.

## Other notes
The game has 20 levels (or 19 if you don't count the last level, which just has
you walk through the exit portal to win the game) and that was quite a bit of
effort to make and in all due honesty I'm not quite if all the levels are unique
and offer quality gameplay. I tried to have some interesting uses of the
mechanics my friend and I implemented and I hope that the game isn't too
repetitive. However, my friend was willing to playtest some of the levels which
was nice and he gave some very good feedback and ideas. Hopefully we can get
some other people to try out the game and give feedback and critique.

Also, I normally use Neovim for programming and I found some stuff on the internet
on using Neovim with Godot but I was lazy and didn't really want to investigate
so I just opted for Godot's built-in editor. It was okay to use but after being
so used to vim it felt weird using the mouse to move around the editor. I might
have to investigate using Neovim with Godot more or at least try to find a way
to add vim keybinds to Godot.

## Conclusion
Overall, this was a very nice project to work on and I'm glad that I was able
to make something interesting with Godot with a friend. I like how the final
product looks and I hope I can get a few people to try it out and get some
feedback.

Anyway, if you are interested in trying it out you can download/play the web
version [on itch.io](https://nullptr-error.itch.io/birb-run).

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/Birb-Games/birb-run)

Anyway that's it, have a nice day!
