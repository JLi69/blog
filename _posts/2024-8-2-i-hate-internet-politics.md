title: "I Hate Internet Politics..."

Okay, so this is going to be a rant about social media, politics, and internet
drama. I've realized that attempting to have any form of meaningful conversation on 
social media about politics is basically futile and will almost never go anywhere
with many people. Instead it will likely just devolve into petty insults and
potentially a flamewar that is a complete waste of everyone's time. The way social
media works is that they want to keep people on their platforms as long as possible
and usually the best emotion for engagement is anger so this leads to an incentive
where people want to create content that gets others like them to be angry at another
side and then this just creates a feedback loop of people wanting to create rage bait
content to pump their social media numbers and people just becoming more exposed to
stuff that makes them angry and hateful of the "other side" and this just continues
in a toxic cycle. This is a problem on pretty much every social media website, ranging
from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. This is mostly the reason why I've decided to
avoid using any of these platforms other than YouTube and to be honest, I'm getting
sick of the flood of useless negative content on YouTube as well.

Quite frankly, both sides of the political spectrum seem to just be completely
incapable of listening to a dissenting opinion that just happens to lean to the
other side. The "woke" and "anti-woke" mobs (I personally think that "woke" is
just a stupid word at this point, it practically just means "something I dislike"
now - I hope within a few years that word will be dead and people will just cringe
when they see old clips of people saying "woke") are basically the same people but
with different opinions. They both get so angry whenever somebody steps remotely
out of line with their opinion and probably spend way too much time on the internet
consuming this rage content. In the end, a lot of controversies are blown out of
proportion and both sides think they are the "right side" and that they are in the
"majority" or whatever which is just simply stupid. I've seen people get called
"fence sitters" and attacked by both sides for simply offering a neutral centrist
take or for trying to be unbiased and actually being levelheaded and doing research
about a topic. It just feels that useless low quality content designed to make people
angry is given the spotlight and all its doing is making the internet into a toxic
dumpster fire.

These internet rage channels and accounts in my opinion have little to no
justification in existing - don't get me wrong, anyone should be allowed a
platform to speak and if they want to create rage content then I suppose that is
within their free speech rights to do so (as long as they don't call for anything
objectively horrible like violence). But whether they have the right to exist is
a completely different question from whether they provide any use. All they do
is pollute the internet with more hate and anger and provide nothing positive or
fun. They don't create art, they don't make fun animations, they don't really
do anything interesting except rally people to get angry at something, and they
don't make anything fun like video games. Yet they seem to dominate the internet
solely so that the people behind these channels can profit off of anger and not
really add anything to the world. Perhaps this post ironically enough is also
inadvertantly contributing to that anger cycle with me getting angry at these
people who post rage content but I still feel that these points must be made.
People are so quick to demonize another side and downvote a dissenting opinion
in a mob mentality that is quite terrifying to see in full action. One of the
reasons that I think has led to this growth of rage content is the rise of clickbait
and people just losing attention span, people don't want to listen to a thought out
argument that is too long for their attention spans and also don't seem to look
past a clickbait thumbnail or title and just proceed to make their opinion on a
subject without even seeing the full context.

This same idea can extend to internet drama, and while there are many serious
situations that do not fit in this category, there also still seem to be many
situations that are blown out of proportion and just seem to create a tide of
toxicity and hate that I think is horrible and useless for society. It just seems
that there is a whole community of people looking to prey upon someone's small
mistake and then try to spin it as "\_\_\_\_\_\_'s CaReEr iS sO oVeR!!11!" and
just continue feeding that wave of hate and just contributes to the cancer that
is cancel culture (cancer culture is a more appropriate name). I'm aware there
are many very serious situations around this time that would be inappropriate 
to call "cancel culture" (I'm not going to name them here because I don't want
to discuss those topics on this blog) but there are still some that aren't that
big of a deal and are usually someone accidentally saying something that
\*gasp\* some people disagree with! Some people just need to go outside and stop
being on social media so much...

Anyway, in summary, internet politics and drama is cancer, social media is cancer,
and I should probably stay off that side of the internet and actually focus on
productive things. We live in a society, blah blah. I might sound like an angry
boomer but I feel that these things are true and I think that we should all strive
to just not feed this toxicity cycle.

Some of the ways that I'm going to try to avoid this part of the internet would be
to just not use social media like Twitter and Reddit (I never really used those
platforms ever so I think I'm good on that front). Perhaps attempting to get away
from these platforms and focusing on other interests such as programming would also
contribute to me being happier and avoiding this toxic side of the internet and
I probably will feel more fulfilled than spending my time scrolling through useless
rage content. Thirdly, for YouTube I'm probably going to experiment with using
an extension to Firefox to hide suggested videos and other things that are
designed to get me into an infinite scroll and waste my time. Hopefully this can
lead to my mental health recovering and I can just avoid useless rage content
from now on.

Anyway, that's it, have a nice day.
