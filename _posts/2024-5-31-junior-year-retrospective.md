title:  "Junior year: A retrospective"
---

Alright, it's May 31st (the board for my school voted this year to chnage the
end of the school year from June to the end of May) and I am officially done with 
11th grade of high school. A lot has happened this year and I have decided to review 
and contemplate some of the things that I have done in this blog post.

# School
This year I took three AP courses (AP Seminar, AP US History, AP Physics II)
which is a decrease from last year when I took five AP courses
(AP Language & Composition, AP European History, AP Computer Science,
AP Physics I, AP Calculus BC). However, I have basically run out
of math classes to take at the high school and instead opted to get early
college credit by taking some college math courses this year (Calculus III and
Linear Algebra). Overall, I feel that the AP courses and college credit courses
that I took this year were not impossible and I did pretty decently in all of
them when it came to grades.

I learned some cool new things in AP Physics II and enjoyed that class quite a
bit. AP US History was okay because I already had some background knowledge on
history - I did feel that the writing at times was rather dry but that's just
my personal experience. AP Seminar was also an interesting course to take as
it was more project oriented and I was able to research some topics that I
actually liked. The only issue was that at the beginning of the class I wasn't
particularly good at presenting (my teacher had us do some practice presentations
with some basic research at the beginning of the year to get a feel for the class
and I didn't really practice my presentation beforehand leading to some rather
scuffed presentations). However, learning from my mistakes, I got better at
presenting by the time we did the official team research project and I had
learned my lesson of needing to practice for presentations and on the day of
the presentation, I actually did fairly decently and my teacher actually seemed
to like what I did. A similar thing happened with the individual research
project. Also, the class includes two essays with each presentation which went
fairly okay for me.

Overall, the AP classes that took this year were fairly decent mostly because
I liked the teachers. However, I still maintain that College Board itself 
still sucks as an organization (I refuse to be a corporate shill) for many 
reasons but that is a rant for another time (and something many other people
have ranted about on the internet) so I will save it.

For the college classes I took, I found them to be quite interesting and I did
pretty decently in them. Linear Algebra and Calculus III were both quite fun
courses to take. Linear Algebra during second semester did conflict a little with
AP Seminar and every other day I ended up having to show up late to AP Seminar
which was unfortunate but things worked out in the end. Overall, college math
was great and I intend on taking more courses during my senior year.

# Extracirriculars
I don't really do many extracirriculars at school in all due honesty. I usually
am not able to find anything that particularly interests me and even when I do
attempt some extracirriculars I end up feeling that I am not contributing
anything of value and feel that it would be better for me to just leave. This
happened with the robotics team this year - I felt I wasn't very useful to the
team and ended up quitting at the beginning of the year. However, I also felt
that robotics also involved programming things that weren't the most interesting
to me. It's unfortunate but I feel a little more free now - I don't have to 
spend time working on code that ultimately is going to be thrown
out in the end for reasons beyond my control and can instead focus on projects
that I can learn from, have fun with, and actually show to the world in the end.
Another thing I attempted this year was to join the Drama Club at my school and
it turns out that I have basically no talent that can really be applied to 
theater. I can't act for the life of me, I have no knowledge with
sound and lighting, and I have mediocre art skills at best (that's me being
somewhat generous to myself). I guess I was vaguely helpful by helping clean up
when needed and sometimes helping paint and build something but I felt that
they could have been fine or better without me. I just stuck around because I
wanted to give the illusion that I was something more than a talentless loser
that is drifting through high school (though in all due honesty, I am a 
talentless loser that is drifting through high school). I gave up being helpful
after a certain point and occasionally did some cleanup and when they didn't
need me I just sat around and did some math and thought about random ideas.

The one extracirricular that I actually did have some amount of success with
was math team. I was able to do somewhat decently in the high school math
competitions this year. However, our high school's math team doesn't administer 
the AMC tests (except for the AMC8 for middle schoolers) so I had to go through 
the high school to take the AMC12. The AMC12 went slightly less smoothly than
anticipated due to the MAA testing website being horribly unresponsive. I did
get a 97.5 (not the best score I could've gotten, considering I made a stupid
mistake on one of the problems) but it was made up by the AIME where I got an
8 leading a USAMO index of 177.5. Not anything to scoff at in my opinion but I
definitely did not qualify for the USAMO.

However, I still notice all my friends seem to be much more active than me -
probably because they have more talents such as music, art, sports, and other
stuff - which makes me question my high school experience so far and wonder if
I really am being involved enough. At the same time though, I value my
independence and quite frankly I feel some amount of pride in working on projects
without the high school interfering or administering it, albeit it ends up
resulting in nobody that I know caring about what I do. Additionally, there are
times when I wonder if I really want anybody that I know in person outside of
my very close friend group to see my projects. These are all questions that I
probably don't have answers to at the moment as my thoughts on them shift
wildly with mood and personal events so I'm not really going to elaborate. 

# Personal Projects
I haven't really done many personal projects this school year mainly because I
was either busy or just lazy. I did make
the game [Scale The Tower](https://nullptr-error.itch.io/scale-the-tower) and
I also worked on some demos such as the OpenGL Infinite Terrain demo that I 
wrote some posts about on this blog and a 
[wave function collapse demo](https://github.com/JLi69/wave-function-collapse-demo)
that I'm actually quite proud of figuring out how to implement. I hopefully
will make some more projects this summer - I have a list and I intend on going
through that list and maybe I might write some blog posts about those projects
as well. We will see.

That's pretty much it for what I wanted to cover on my junior year of
high school. Not exciting in my opinion. Anyway that's it, have a nice day!
