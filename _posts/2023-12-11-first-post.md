title:  "First Post!"
---

I've decided to create a blog! Here I'll probably share thoughts, projects, and
interesting things that I find. I'm not sure how often I will post or when
exactly I will post but hopefully you end up finding my posts a worthwhile
read. Also, I plan on customizing the blog in the future to have a custom theme
and also have it not have such a generic title ("Blog" is a rather boring name for a 
blog...). I'm not entirely sure what I want the  style of this blog to be and I 
also don't know what I want the current title to be right now either... I want 
something creative and unique but at the same time I have trouble naming things 
("There are three hard problems in computer science: off by one errors, cache 
invalidation, and naming things"). I'll probably eventually figure it out.

Anyway, I should probably introduce myself! I am currently in high school and my
interests include math, physics, and computer science. I am also a ~~failed~~
_aspiring_ indie game developer (so maybe expect posts on games that I might
be working on at the moment). If you really care about knowing more about me
you can go [here](https://jli69.github.io/aboutme.html) to read more.

My most recent project is a game known as 
[Scale The Tower](https://nullptr-error.itch.io/scale-the-tower) (shameless
self promotion time!). It's a simple little platformer game where you have to
climb a procedurally generated tower and avoid enemies while collecting treasure.
If you think that looks interesting, please go check it out! 
You can find the source code for STT [here](https://github.com/JLi69/scale-the-tower).

Anyway, that's about it, have a nice day!
