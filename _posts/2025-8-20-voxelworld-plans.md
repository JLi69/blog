title:  "My current plans for Voxelworld development"
---

Okay, so I just released a minor update for Voxelworld (`v0.4.1`) which just
updated the appearance of the main menu and added a settings screen (there are
only two settings the player can change at the moment - how clouds are rendered
and the render distance).

However, now that I the basic features of survival mode completed, I now need
to think about what my next steps forward should be for this project and this
post will just outline what I am currently planning on doing.

I said in the [previous post](https://jli69.github.io/blog/2025/08/15/voxelworld-v0.4.0-released.html)
that I wanted `v0.5.0` to be focused on implementing entities such as animals
and monsters but I have since decided to make some changes in the development
roadmap. I currently want `v0.5.0` to be a smaller feature update in which
some random extra features that I want to implement with no major changes or
additions to the engine. I have a list of ideas that I think would be interesting
to implement but for now I won't give too many details.

I mainly decided to do a smaller update since `v0.4.0` took multiple months
(basically my entire summer) to finish. I kind of want to take a break from
having to implement a lot of new engine features and with college looming for
me, it might be best to have a smaller project to focus on while I adjust and
start my classes. I can then hopefully have a better assessment of how much
free time I'll have to work on side projects.

Once I have `v0.5.0` completed, the plan is to then develop `v0.6.0` in which
I plan to implement entities such as monsters and animals. I do already have
some basic code implemented for entities with dropped items but dropped items
are significantly more simple than an enemy like a slime/zombie.

In short, the plan at the moment is that `v0.5.0` will be a somewhat smaller update 
while `v0.6.0` will implement monsters/animals.

Anyway, that's it, have a nice day!
