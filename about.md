Weclome to my blog! Here I'll post random things that I currently find
interesting or worth sharing. My interests include programming, physics,
mathematics, computer graphics, and video games.

### Explanation of Blog Title
__IP.SH__ is an acronym for **I** **P**ost **S**tuff **H**ere, 
a rather on the nose  reference to the fact that this is my blog and of 
course I post stuff here. It also is a nice combination of two computer terms 
(IP for Internet Protocol and SH for Shell - bash/zsh) which I thought was fun 
so I decided to settle on that as my blog name.
